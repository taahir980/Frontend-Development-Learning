Domain Name :-
      - A human readable name that is used to identify a website, such as www.google.com

      - It is a string of text that maps to an alphanumeric IP address, which is
      used to access a website from client software (Browser).

      - In plain English, a domain name is the text that a user types into a browser window to reach a particular website.

      - The actual address of a website is a complex numerical IP address (e.g. 192.0.2.2), but thanks to DNS,
      users are able to enter human-friendly domain names and be routed to the websites they are looking for.


Difference between Domain Name & URL ?

      - A uniform resource locator (URL), sometimes called a web address, contains the domain name of a site as well as other 
      information, including the protocol and the path.

      - For example, in the URL ‘https://cloudflare.com/learning/’, ‘cloudflare.com’ is the domain name,
      while HTTPS is the protocol and ‘/learning/’ is the path to a specific page on the website.
