      <!--                              Semantic

            - In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code.

            - for example  "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)
      -->


      <!--                            Semantic HTML

            - It refers to the use of HTML markup to convey the meaning of the content on a web page, rather than just its appearance.

            - This approach has several benefits. First, it helps search engines and other technologies to understand the structure and the purpose of content on your site.

            - Second, it makes your content more accessible to people who use assistive technologies to navigate the web.

            - And third, it makes your code easier to read and maintain, since the purpose of each element is clear.

            - Every semantic element indicate to both users and search engines that this section of your website is specifically designed for this purpose i.e navigation, main-content, article, section, header etc.
      -->


      <!--          <header>

            - includes the main title or logo, navigation links, and other elements that are common to every page on the site.

            - It can create a clear separation between the header and the main content of your page, making it easier for users to understand and navigate your website.
