/*     Difference between var & let keyword ?
   - Var is function scope i.e it can be accessible and manipulated anywhere inside the function. Whereas Let is block scoped i.e it is identified or exist inside a specific scope, outside that it is non existent or dead.
   - Hoisting happens differently in these two type of variables.
