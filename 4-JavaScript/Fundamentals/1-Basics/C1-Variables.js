   - In javascript var, let & const are three ways to declare variables.
   - javascript varibles are not attached to any perticular type, means it can store any type of data i.e num, string, boolean etc.
   - That's why it is known as dynamically typed language.

var userId2 = "54657774";

const currentState2 = 'ajao re';

/*  ++++++++  Diffrence Between Var, Let & Const  ++++++++
   Var:-
      - Var type variables are functional scope.
      - It can be redeclared & re-initialized  as many time as possible.
      - declared without initialization.
      - It can be accessed before declaration.
   Let:-
      - Let type of variables are block scoped.
      -(Block is a certain region of program where variables are exist and identified, Beyond that it doesn't.)
      - It can't be redeclared. But reinitialized as many time as possible.
      - It can't be accessed before declaration.
   Const:-
      - Const are also block scoped.
      - It should be intialized during declaration.
      - It is not possible to re-initialize of redeclared.
      - Same here
